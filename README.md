## Business Developer manager to Software engineering.
I am a graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. After graduating I was working with a software company as a business developer to create long-term value for the company from customers, markets and relationships. Six months later, I decided to fully focus on my dream of software engineering because I had a passion of computers since I was a kid (12 years old). But the main reason I went for a business career in the first place was that I wanted to learn practically how software business works and the true benefits and struggles of pushing a product/idea to the market.

## I love coding.
Programming is a social activity. It is like writing a book that users will find a transformation in and can be read with ease. It is about the structure and the flow of inspiring events and states. The code is more importance than how it works. The code should be readable and enhanced by developers other than its original author. It should have meaninful names. It should provide one way rather than many ways of doing one thing. The code should look like the programming langange was made to solve that problem. It should be simple and direct.
